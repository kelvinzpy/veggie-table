Current issues:
Video playback too fast (could be something to do with native vs playback framerate?)
Program shows "error: display Surface quit" after terminating even with pygame.quit() and exit()


To-do list:
Organize the script because it is super messy and gross
  - without completely bugging the script out
Figure out how to print stuff onto the GUI instead of only on the console
  - Fidelity check
  - improper input warnings
  - other printed stuff (e.g. confirmation messages)
Allow the user to choose food types before each video begins
  - Need a preview frame of the video
  - Plus probably a couple of selection boxes/list for each food
Put an indicator on the screen whenever LEFT/RIGHT arrows are pressed (was thinking a green light of sorts on the bottom left/right corner)
Allow the user to fast-forward a video (or play it at variable speeds)
