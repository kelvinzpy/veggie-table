Current issues:
code is messy :(
Program shows "error: display Surface quit" after terminating even with pygame.quit() and exit()

To-do list:
Organize the script because it is super messy and gross
  - without completely bugging the script out
Figure out how to print stuff onto the GUI instead of only on the console
  - Fidelity check
  - improper input warnings
  - other printed stuff (e.g. confirmation messages)
Allow the user to choose food types before each video begins
  - Need a preview frame of the video:
      - going to either do this via a separate function (that adds a third column ("preview frame") to the initial spreadsheet), or
      - pause the video playback immediately after it begins and allow for selection
  - Plus probably a couple of selection boxes/list for each food
Allow the user to fast-forward a video (or play it at variable speeds)
Various safety nets for catching silly inputs :>
